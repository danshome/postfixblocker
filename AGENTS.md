# AGENTS

This repository contains a Python service and Angular web UI for managing a Postfix block list.

## Development instructions

- Run unit tests with `pytest` from the repository root.
- Follow standard PEP8 style for Python code.
- The README previously referenced `tests/end_to_end_test.py`, but that file does not exist.
- `tests/e2e_demo.py` is an unfinished demonstration script that currently hangs and should not be relied on.
- Update documentation and this file if the end-to-end demo is fixed or new tests are added.
