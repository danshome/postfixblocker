# Security Policy

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: SECURITY:MAIN -->

We take security seriously. This document explains how to report
vulnerabilities and which versions are supported.

## Supported Versions

The project follows a rolling release model for the main branch. The minimum
supported toolchain is {{MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS}}. Versioned releases, if any,
will be listed here with support windows.

| Version | Supported          |
|--------:|--------------------|
| main    | Yes                |
| x.y.z   | TODO               |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Email: {{CONTACT_EMAIL}}
- Optional PGP key: {{SECURITY_PGP_KEY_URL}}

Please include:
- Affected version(s) and environment
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact assessment and suggested mitigations

We aim to acknowledge reports within 2 business days and provide a timeline
for remediation after triage.

## Disclosure Policy

We prefer coordinated disclosure. We will keep all reports confidential, apply
fixes, and publish security advisories when appropriate.

## Supply Chain

- We use lockfiles where applicable and encourage pinning dependencies.
- Dependabot (or equivalent) may be enabled to monitor vulnerabilities.
